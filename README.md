# Redis Clone Go
A redis clone but this time in Go.

Based on the same project I made with C, but now in Go. Since Go is not necessarily an object-oriented programming language (like C# or Java) 
but has some things I find unique in its syntax, I thought best to create a clone of the project using Go to test my recently gained knowledge.

Go does not have a `free` function (has Garbage Collection) but it is pretty fast. The key value store is still the same fast thing running on a C implementation.

It wasn't tested in a production environment yet, so I don't know how fast or stable the project is in Go, but it is still fast regardless of the
memory management.
